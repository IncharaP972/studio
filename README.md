4. In your project settings (‚öôÔ∏è > Project settings), go to the "Your apps" section.
5. **Add a web app** if you haven't already.

    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",

    };
7. Use these values to populate your `.env.local` file as shown above.

## Database Setup

This project uses Firebase Firestore. No initial schema setup is required, as the application creates collections and documents on the fly.

However, for proper functionality, you must deploy the Firestore Security Rules from the `firestore.rules` file in this repository.  
Use the Firebase CLI:
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
